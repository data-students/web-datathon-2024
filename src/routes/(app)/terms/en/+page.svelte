    email address provided.</p>

  <h3 class="pt-6">The rules of the competition</h3>

  <ol class="list-decimal pt-4 pl-10">
    <li>There is no minimum team size, however, the maximum size is 4 people. There will be 1 prize for each member of
      the team, independently of the team size.</li>
    <li>Teams should be made up exclusively of students who are not organizers, judges, sponsors, or in any other
      privileged position at the event.</li>
    <li>All team members should be accepted into the Datathon by the organization and registered into the online
      platforms/forms used before and during the event.</li>
    <li>All team members should be reachable by any member of the organization team during the event.</li>
    <li>Teams can, of course, gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, mentors and other related
      people to the Datathon.</li>
    <li>All work on a project should be done at the Datathon.</li>
    <li>Teams can use an idea they had before the event.</li>
    <li>Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Solutions do not have to be “innovative”, although it is a
      plus.</li>
    <li>Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).</li>
    <li>Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the
      event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the
      rules and is not allowed.</li>
    <li>Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced, or
      new features added during the Datathon in determining the winners.</li>
    <li>Teams must stop working once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to make small fixes to their
      programs/documents after time is up. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.</li>
    <li>Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed (clause 3).</li>
    <li>Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers’ discretion. Reasons might include, but are not

  </ol>

  <h3 class="pt-6">Demos</h3>

  <p>After the working time finishes, teams will show their projects to each other and to the judges.</p>

  <p>In order to present your project to Datathon FME judges and sponsors, you would need to be able to sign up and log
    in to third-party services complying with the applicable laws of your country. Agreeing with the terms and
    conditions of any third-party service suggested, used or proposed by the organization.</p>

  <p>You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches or presentations are also an option.
  </p>

  <p>You are encouraged to present what you have done, even if your solution is broken, or you weren’t able to finish.
    It’s okay if you didn’t finish your project, that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging
    criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It’s a chance to share with
    others what you learned and what you tried to build! In the case that you don’t have anything to demo, you can give
    a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and
    inspiring for other attendees.</p>

  <h3 class="pt-6">Judging Criteria</h3>

  <p>Teams will be judged on several criteria, which may include but are not limited to:

  <ul class="list-disc pt-4 pl-10">
    <li>Idea &amp; Innovation: How good is the idea? Is it innovative?</li>
    <li>Technology: How technically impressive was the solution? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult?
      Did it use a particularly interesting data science technique?</li>
    <li>Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new?</li>
    <li>Design & usability: Was the solution intuitive to use? Was it well-thought? </li>
    <li>Presentation: Did you clearly communicate your solution and/or your conclusions? </li>

    <li>Efficiency: Is your solution efficient? Is it scalable?</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="pt-4">Note that these criteria are just guidelines. Ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut
    feeling about which projects are the most impressive and deserving.</p>

    obligation to make public the criteria. The non-acceptance of the method chosen by the Organizers will be
    cause for withdrawal of the prize.</p>

    inaccurate information provided by the participant. The Organizers reserve the right to replace any winner if we
